# VoidInstall: Interactive Void Linux Installer

VoidInstall is a modern, interactive, and user-friendly installer for Void Linux, inspired by Archinstall. It automates disk partitioning, hardware detection, user setup, desktop environment installation, and moreâ€”all from a single script.

## Features
- Auto/manual disk partitioning (UEFI & BIOS support)
- Force unmounts and wipes disks safely
- Hardware detection (CPU, GPU, WiFi, Bluetooth)
- Installs microcode, drivers, and firmware as needed
- User creation with sudo setup
- Desktop environment selection (XFCE, GNOME, KDE, or none)
- Sound system setup (ALSA, PulseAudio, PipeWire)
- Bootloader installation (GRUB, UEFI/BIOS aware)
- Colorful, clear, and interactive terminal UI
- Dependency checking and auto-installation

## Usage
1. **Boot into a Void Linux live environment** (with internet access).
2. **Run as root:**
   ```bash
      python 3voidinstall.py
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts** for disk selection, partitioning, user setup, desktop, etc.

## Requirements
- Void Linux live ISO (recommended)
- Internet connection (for package installation)
- Python 3

The script will check for and install any missing dependencies automatically.

## Notes
- All data on the selected disk will be erased during auto-partitioning.
- For UEFI systems, an EFI partition (FAT32, 512M+) is required.
- For BIOS systems, only root (ext4) and optional swap are required.
- The installer will set up all necessary chroot mounts and unmounts automatically.

## Troubleshooting
- If you cancel the install, the script will force unmount all partitions and clean up before retrying.
- If you encounter issues, check the output for error messages and ensure you are running from a Void Linux live environment.

## Disclaimer
Before you use this, please read this disclaimer(s): 
- If you use LUKS Encryption with LVM and do automatic formatting, the script will automatically format the root as ext4, however, with setting up encryption, you will have to format that partition again (using luksFormat to create the encrypted partitioning scheme , and then ext4 for the /dev/mapper/cryptroot (basically a reference to the encrypted partition scheme)
- If you choose to setup encrypted, follow the instructions in the script, which basically state that leave the script using CTRL + C and then follow the commands it specifies, and then come back to it and run it again
